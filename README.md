# Welcome to my C language projects

###  <span style="color:red">Project 1 -Steganography</span>

This C project implements an algorithm for encrypting text data of a chosen image.            
The algorithm takes advantage of bit-wise operation, so the change in the image is undetectable for the naked eye.
also, I implement a demonstration of simple image processing technics.

###  <span style="color:red">Project 1 -PID controller</span>
a physical sensor sends data with an RS-232 cable to a microcontroller.
the PID controller analyzes the sensor and give order to the physical heating element to heat the system in a supervised way.
